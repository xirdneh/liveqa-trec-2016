statement on january 21 2016 criticizing s healthcare plan for being vague her website promises she ll expand affordable coverage slow the growth of overall health care costs and make it possible for

5 000 dollar deductible you know what that means when you re sick you don t go to the doctor sanders said one out of five people in this country cannot even fill the prescription that their doctor

capita than we are estimates by gerald friedman an economist at the university of massachusetts at amherst retained by the sanders campaign show sanders plan reducing medicare costs by 6 3 trillion from 2017 to 2026 however according to an opinion piece in forbes by avik roy an advisor to the plan could potentially increase federal spending by around 28 trillion or 55 percent over the same time period roy remarks in his article that the opinions expressed do not necessarily correspond to those of sen rubio republican candidates ted cruz see also at the on february 6 2016 discussed repealing obamacare socialized medicine is a disaster it does not work if you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine that have put the government in charge of providing medicine what inevitably happens is rationing if i m elected president we will repeal every word of obamacare and once we do that we will adopt common sense reforms number one we ll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance we ll expand health savings accounts and we will de link health insurance from employment so that you don t lose your health insurance when you lose your job and that way health insurance can be personal portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors cruz said on january 10 2016 that he would not repeal on his first day in office because he would not have the constitutional authority to do so the only way to end it is to repeal that statute we will repeal obamacare but unlike i don t intend as president to be to use his word an emperor cruz said cruz voted in favor of a bill to repeal large portions of on december 3 2015 while discussing his healthcare platform at the on august 3 2015 cruz said i ve been proud to lead the fight to stop in the united states senate against the washington cartel and there are a lot of politicians in washington that have largely given up they don t believe obamacare can ever be repealed including sadly a fair number of republicans i don t believe that i intend to make 2016 a referendum on repealing obamacare and if i m elected president we will repeal every word of obamacare and we ll pass commonsense health insurance reform to make health insurance personal and portable and affordable john kasich see also s administration announced on january 19 2016 new voluntary guidelines for the prescription of short term pain medication according to the lexington herald leader people with short term pain from injuries or surgery should be given alternatives to prescription painkillers whenever possible and be provided only the minimum amounts if absolutely needed on january 8 2016 kasich said he opposed paid maternity leave recommending instead flexible working arrangements the one thing we need to do for working women is to give them the flexibility to be able to work at home online the reason why that s important is when women take maternity leave or time to be with the children then what happens is they fall behind on the experience level which means that the pay becomes a differential he said kasich described the healthcare system he would like to see succeed the in an interview with npr s scott simon on july 25 2015 kasich said i d like to replace it with a health care system that would be market driven that would begin to shift us to quality based health care rather than quantity based health care in other words with the primary care doctor being the shepherd to shepherd us through our health care needs with insurance companies and hospitals working together to share profits to share the gains they make by keeping people healthy rather than treating them on the basis of how they re sick according to project vote smart supports a managed competition healthcare plan that would contain costs and improve access that does not include mandated health alliances government cost control powers or employer employee mandates he also said that he would support reforms to allow healthcare to be purchased in other states reduce frivolous lawsuits cover pre existing medical issues give incentives for people to live healthy lifestyles and implement electronic medical records donald trump see also on march 2 2016 trump released a seven point plan for healthcare reform which he described as based on free market principles he stated that he would repeal obamacare reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals make health saving accounts inheritable require price transparency block grant medicaid to the states and allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers trump added that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs at the on february 6 2016 discussed his position on healthcare and whether it is closer to s or i think i m closer to common sense we are going to repeal we are going to replace obamacare with something so much better and there are so many examples of it and i will tell you part of the reason we have some people laughing because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here i am self funded the only one they re not taking care of is me we have our lines around each state the insurance companies are getting rich on obamacare the insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health we are going to end that we re going to take out the artificial boundaries the artificial lines we re going to get a plan where people compete free enterprise they compete so much better in addition to that you have the health care savings plans which are excellent what i do say is there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a i don t want that to happen we re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we re going to take care of those people and i think everybody on this stage would have to agree you re not going to let people die sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country trump suggested that he supported universal healthcare on september 27 2015 i am going to take care of everybody i don t care if it costs me votes or not everybody s going to be taken care of much better than they re taken care of now he said in a july 2015 forbes interview on how trump would replace a trump spokesperson said mr trump will be proposing a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles mr trump s plan will provide choice to the buyer provide individual tax relief for health insurance and keep plans portable and affordable the plan will break the health insurance company monopolies and allow individuals to buy across state lines withdrawn candidates democratic lincoln chafee see also following the s upholding of the affordable care act in 2012 said in a press release it is an economic imperative that we address the problem of uninsured rhode islanders and rising healthcare costs i m confident of the clear path forward that we have marked to achieve universal coverage for rhode islanders and now we can get back to that important work with this decision behind us also adopted medicaid expansion under the affordable care act although chafee sought to reduce spending on medicaid by 43 million in his final budget lawrence lessig see also said unlike he would keep obamacare s cadillac tax a tax on high cost employer healthcare plans economists can say little with certainty but they are all pretty united on the view that super premium benefit packages burden middle class wages so long as the tax remains targeted on the luxury plans i would retain it lessig told politico on october 14 2015 he also reiterated his overall support for in september 2015 lessig called the most important thing president did in an interview with reason in august 2015 lessig said obamacare was an important piece of legislation but suggested that it had been partially designed with pharmaceutical companies interests in mind lessig said it has incredibly important compromises built in that are only there because of the money for example even though obama ridiculed george bush s prescription drug law for the rule that says the government can t negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers that provision is in obamacare and why is it in obamacare because the pharmaceutical companies basically said they would spend millions of dollars to defeat democrats if it weren t included martin o malley see also on august 7 2015 said that healthcare reform must eliminate the profit motive for hospital ceos who keep their hospitals solvent by keepings the beds filled o malley pointed to a program he developed while to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions in 2012 o malley opted to create a state healthcare exchange under in april 2014 o malley replaced the failed maryland health connection with the technology connecticut developed for its obamacare website accesshealthct jim webb see also sen jim webb on health care reform november 12 2009 in april 2012 criticized the way the healthcare law known as was passed and developed he said i think that the manner in which the health care reform issue was put in front of the congress the way that the issue was dealt with by the white house cost obama a lot of credibility as a leader in 2009 webb voted for h r 3590 the patient protection and affordable care act also known as it became law on march 23 2010 republican jeb bush see also criticized a decision of the food and drug administration s to support of a version of slow release oxycontin for children bush voiced his concern on november 4 2015 in new england has seen a surge of deaths related to prescription opioids on october 13 2015 bush rolled out a plan to replace his plan would put limits on federal payments to states and create a transition plan for the 17 million people receiving insurance coverage under obamacare he proposed providing higher tax credits for purchasing catastrophic health insurance and would allow higher contribution limits on health savings accounts for out of pocket expenses the plan also proposed to limit the tax free status of employer provided health insurance the proposal would also give power to the states to design medicaid programs and increase funding for the national institutes of health in november 2013 bush said that the affordable care act is flawed to its core if the objective is don t worry about the budget we ll just finance it the same way we re financing our deficits right now build a bigger debt you could see this thing surviving but it will have failed what the promises were it will have failed the american people and i don t think it will bend the cost curve during an october 2013 speech bush said obamacare needs to be repealed according to politico ben carson see also at the carson discussed the details of his healthcare plan saying well first of all healthcare is not a right but i do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society and we are that we spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do i propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats and we give it to everybody from birth until death they can pass it on when they die we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family so dad s 500 short mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man it gives you enormous flexibility and also you know if uncle joe is smoking like a chimney everybody s going to hide his cigarettes because they re all interested in what s going on there also the your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare so it s like a homeowners policy with a large deductible versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered one costs 1 500 a year one costs 10 000 a year you can buy the 1 500 one that will take care of 75 percent of the people the people who are indigent how do we take care of them now medicaid what s the medicaid budget almost 500 billion almost 80 million people participate which is way too many and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy which i hope we get a chance to talk about but do the math over 5 000 for each man woman and child and all they will have a lot more flexibility what could you buy with that a concierge practice and you could still have thousands of dollars left over and let me just finish because i don t get to talk that much and you know let s you can have the money that s left over to buy your catastrophic insurance but most importantly we give them a menu just like we do in medicare part c and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care but drug care and everything else it will be such a good program that nobody will want obamacare after that and that s probably the best way do it although if anybody still did i would still de fund it at the on february 6 2016 talked about his opposition to obamacare the reason that i dislike obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people which the nation is supposed to be centered on that we don t care what you think this is what we re doing and if you don t like it too bad that s a problem and we can t afford to do that because that will fundamentally change america i have proposed a health empowerment account system everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born they keep it until they die they can pass it on we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don t have as such sic access we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman that saves you a n awful lot of money carson wrote an op ed in the boston globe on december 15 2015 to highlight his proposal to create health empowerment accounts heas he wrote that they will be available to anyone with a valid social security number these accounts will be owned specifically by the individual and not by the government or large corporations the accounts will also remain with the owner through job changes or state to state relocation heas will be created for every child at birth and are freely transferable from one family member to another carson released his healthcare reform on december 9 2015 at the core of carson s platform was the combination of tax protected health empowerment accounts and high deductible health insurance plans additionally carson s plan supported transferable plans across state lines and family members a fixed contribution for beneficiaries to select the insurance plan of their choice and the gradual increase of the eligibility age for medicare to 70 carson s plan also called for overhauling the joint federal state health program for the poor giving users private insurance options which would be funded through state run medicaid programs and seed funds for their own health empowerment accounts chris christie see also in march 2014 referred to the or obamacare as a failed federal program he applauded the healthcare system already in place in new jersey stating we ve expanded medicaid we re the second most generous medicaid program in the united states of america christie formed the following four point plan to address the healthcare issue in new jersey increase the number of affordable health insurance options through increased competition emphasize early detection and preventive care eliminate the assessment i e tax on individual and small group premiums fight fraud waste and abuse in the healthcare and health insurance systems in 2012 christie vetoed legislation that would have created a state healthcare exchange he commented i will not ask new jerseyans to commit today to a state based exchange when the federal government cannot tell us what it will cost how that cost compares to other options and how much control they will give the states over this option that comes at the cost of our state s taxpayers in 2013 christie introduced a state budget that included an expansion in medicaid carly fiorina see also wrote an op ed in time to promote her plan to repeal and promote the free market in healthcare she said obamacare should be replaced with a plan that protects those with pre existing conditions in state run high risk pools reduces costs protects religious liberty and moves us closer to real genuine competition that drives down costs and drives up quality she pointed to the healthcare proposal of u s rep r ga as an example of such a plan in a interview with glamour published january 12 2016 fiorina called for the government to require healthcare related companies to publish their prices costs and outcomes she said emergency room visits are up health insurance premiums are up we re throwing more and more people into medicaid and yet fewer and fewer doctors are accepting reimbursement for medicaid insurance we need to try the free markets but one thing the government should mandate i don t use that term lightly is that every health care provider every health insurance company the pharmaceutical industry publish their prices costs and outcomes that s the only way to start putting power back in the hands of patients transparency at the fiorina discussed her views on healthcare she said obamacare has to be repealed because it s failing the very people it was intended to help but also it is croney capitalism sic at its worst who helped write this bill drug companies insurance companies pharmaceutical companies every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government see that s what happens as government gets bigger and bigger and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike and business have to bulk up to deal with big government so we have to repeal it it s tens of thousands of pages long no one can possible sic understand it except the big companies the lawyers the accountants the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests then we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool we need to try the one thing in health insurance we ve never tried health insurance has always been a cozy little game between regulators and health insurance companies we need to try the free market the free market where people actually have to compete during a town hall event in fiorina argued that healthcare would be improved if consumers had more information about costs she said the federal government should mandate that healthcare providers of all kinds publish on a regular basis their costs their prices and their outcomes in september 2015 sarah isgur flores a spokeswoman for fiorina said the candidate had not supported an individual mandate during a 2013 interview flores explained she was agreeing with the heritage proposal which said that there would be some type of catastrophic care requirement set up a little like auto damage liability insurance aimed at reducing taxpayer costs of unexpected er visits not what required which is actually high end insurance coverage in her 2010 economic growth plan fiorina proposed repealing obamacare and replacing it with a bill that relies on creating more competition reducing the role of government lowering costs and enhancing the quality of care during a september 2010 debate fiorina said let us subsidize a high risk pool for high risk individuals it would cost us much less money than this health care bill jim gilmore see also opposed in a june 2015 interview he said if i were president i would seek to eliminate that approach i m not against healthcare but i would not be in favor of the obamacare state type of approach i believe we were doing better when we liberated businesses to offer these kinds of programs through the private sector the business of insurance was to in fact try to find the best quality product to make people as healthy as possible there were some people who did not have that opportunity and frankly if you have a lousy economy we do not always get those benefits and then you do have to take care of those situations but i believe that a free market based economy where people have an incentive to offer a better healthcare product or a better premium is the right way we should be going in the same june 2015 interview gilmore said that he supported children being able to stay on their parents insurance for longer and the obamacare approach to pre existing conditions he said these select provisions were very beneficial and that the approach would in the free market economy adjust itself in the premium appropriately lindsey graham see also voted in favor of a bill to repeal large portions of on december 3 2015 during a town hall meeting hosted by u s sen r s c in september 2015 graham said seniors in his income bracket should pay actual medical premiums instead of having them subsidized to 40 percent of the cost under medicare graham co sponsored several bills to defund and repeal the patient protection and affordable care act including s 1292 the defund obamacare act of 2013 s 1272 the exchange sunset act of 2013 and s 177 the obamacare repeal act following the roll out of the affordable care act website graham said the president promised if you liked your health care you could keep it he said it d be as cheap as a cell phone and easy as sic to access as amazon com so he s oh for three how could for three years you haven t noticed that you got to roll out a website on a certain day and it not work everybody s responsible but nobody s to blame i guess is sort of what i learned graham declined his employer contribution toward the affordable care act and purchased his healthcare through healthcare exchange graham explained that his healthcare was cheaper and covered more before he enrolled he said sadly i m not the only one who will feel the negative effects of obamacare it s happening all over south carolina in 2011 graham introduced s 1587 the medicaid flexibility for states act which proposed allowing states to opt out of one or more of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act graham co sponsored s 707 the preemie act which sought to reduce preterm birth infant mortality and pregnancy related death it became law on december 22 2006 mike huckabee see also in june 2015 denounced the ruling in which stated that tax credit subsidies were permissible for insurance purchased from any type of exchange under calling the decision an out of control act of judicial tyranny huckabee added as president i will protect medicare repeal obamacare and pass real reform that will actually lower costs while focusing on cures and prevention rather than intervention in december 2013 huckabee said obamacare was not working out very well and president was making arbitrary changes to the law as a result while appearing at the value voters summit in 2010 huckabee opposed requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre existing conditions comparing the concept to requiring property insurance companies to cover a building that burned down on his 2008 campaign website huckabee wrote we can make health care more affordable by reforming medical liability adopting electronic record keeping making health insurance more portable from one job to another expanding health savings accounts to everyone not just those with high deductibles and making health insurance tax deductible for individuals and families as it now is for businesses low income families would get tax credits instead of deductions we don t need all the government controls that would inevitably come with universal health care when i m president americans will have more control of their health care options not less bobby jindal see also wrote an op ed in forbes on august 25 2015 arguing that had made healthcare unaffordable and s healthcare proposal would contribute to the problem governor walker s refundable credit from cradle to grave for every american is not only a new federal entitlement program but it guarantees that the government pays for health insurance any guarantee that everyone will have government funded health insurance will increase the cost of healthcare because when government guarantees spending the system will charge as much as possible to meet the supply jindal wrote in an interview with newsmax tv in august 2015 jindal said should be replaced with a system of cross state purchase of insurance so you have more competition an expanded access to medical and health savings accounts and wellness accounts and a crackdown on frivolous lawsuits in 2014 jindal announced his proposed plan to replace according to the wall street journal the plan would create a grant program giving states incentives to find ways to lower premium costs while guaranteeing access to insurance for people with existing conditions mr jindal says the grant money 100 billion over 10 years would be raised by making changes to medical malpractice law and from other sources in 2013 jindal opposed medicaid expansion under the affordable care act george pataki see also called the affordable care act also known as the worst law of my lifetime during a march 2015 interview with newsmaxtv pataki stated that the law was unconstitutional and should be repealed at the leadership summit in on april 17 2015 pataki espoused the benefits of a market based healthcare system and added we should allow consumers to purchase across state lines and get rid of the junk negligence lawsuits that drive up the cost of medicine rand paul see also voted in favor of a bill to repeal large portions of on december 3 2015 wolf blitzer of cnn interviews paul in february 2014 on obamacare when asked in january 2015 what would happen if the affordable care act otherwise known as obamacare were repealed paul answered we could try freedom for a while we had it for a long time that s where you sell something and i agree to buy it because i like it that is how we operate in most of rest of the marketplace other than health care now the president has said you can only buy certain types of health care that i approve of and anything i don t approve of you are not allowed to purchase we could try freedom i think it might work it works everywhere else prior to entering public service paul was an ophthalmologist for 18 years on his presidential campaign website paul wrote as a doctor i have had firsthand experience with the immense problems facing health care in the united states prior to the implementation of obamacare our health care system was over regulated and in need of serious market reforms but obamacare is not the answer paul added i was not a member of the united states senate during the but if i had been i would have voted against obamacare as your one of my first acts would be to repeal the abomination that is obamacare paul described alternatives to healthcare on his senate website paul wrote government interventions in health care have driven up the cost of coverage i have long supported making all medical expenses tax deductible allowing insurance to be bought across state lines tort reform state level and empowering all citizens to save for health expenses by removing the high deductible insurance policy requirement to access to sic health savings accounts in january 2013 paul cosponsored s 177 obamacare repeal act while speaking at harvard university s institute of politics paul later conceded in 2014 that it would be difficult to eliminate obamacare now that consumers have become accustomed to it instead paul recommended making it voluntary and to get rid of the coercion in 2010 paul argued against a socialized healthcare system paul wrote socialist medicine does not work because socialism does not work when people blame the current crisis on the free market they are making a grave intellectual error simply because these large companies are benefiting does not mean we currently have a free market when the government passes legislation regulations and mandates this can hardly be called a free market it is well known that socialism leads to long lines rationing and a lack of choice but more importantly socialized medicine stifles innovation we might not have the best coverage in this country as a result of government intervention but we do have the best health care that is because we are the only country that rewards innovation on the market place the answer therefore is more and not less freedom while speaking before the center right coalition in 2009 paul suggested several methods to minimize medicare paul said we can t just eliminate medicare but we have to figure out how to get more to a market based system it s counter intuitive to a lot of people but you have to pay for things if you want prices to come down so you really need higher deductibles and the real answer to medicare would be a 2 000 deductible but try selling that one in an election but that s the real answer is you have to pay for things and when you do but you also get rid of price controls so you raise the deductible you get rid of price controls and you allow more competition and you may have to allow more competition from other parties nurse practitioners we already have some pharmacists there have to be ways to allow medicine to come down rick perry see also according to bloomberg in june 2015 recommended repealing the affordable care act also known as perry cautioned however that should not institute a replacement instead states should be allowed to come up with an alternative system while visiting new jersey in october 2013 perry said if this health care law is forced upon this country the young men and women in this audience are the ones who are really going to pay the price and that i will suggest to you reaches to the point of being a felony toward them and their future that is a criminal act from my perspective to put that type of burden on them to mortgage their future like that america cannot stand that america cannot accept that in september 2009 perry released a statement on his opposition to federal mandates perry said instead of government mandates and more deficit spending successful health care reforms can be achieved only by providing states the flexibility to develop state specific solutions i urge you to support our right as a state to further explore these approaches rather than forcing us to implement federal mandates that promise financial hardships for the states and little in the way of benefits for our economy and all of our constituents with the support of the texas medical association in 2011 perry signed legislation requiring the losing party in a frivolous lawsuit to pay the winning party s legal expenses in 2003 perry succeeded in establishing a state constitutional amendment that capped non economic damages to 750 000 in medical malpractice lawsuits perry signed an executive order in 2007 requiring girls entering the sixth grade to be vaccinated for the human papapillomavirus hpv in 2011 perry said the order was a mistake and supported the s toppling of the law explaining his decision in an interview in august 2011 perry said the fact of the matter is that i didn t do my research well enough to understand that we needed to have a substantial conversation with our citizenry in 2007 perry signed into law a medicaid reform bill that provided premium subsidies to low income texans and gave incentives for individuals to maintain their health marco rubio see also while discussing healthcare for disabled individuals on january 27 2016 recounted his grandfather s struggle with polio he said imagine being disabled at the turn of a century in a developing country like cuba and having to raise seven girls which is what he had to do it was hard he struggled most of his life to do that rubio said high risk pools should be established by the state to help those with chronic and serious conditions who could not otherwise obtain health insurance he noted however that he believed some in the u s were cheating the system rubio voted in favor of a bill to repeal large portions of on december 3 2015 at a campaign event in new hampshire on october 16 2015 rubio criticized pharmaceutical companies of pure profiteering according to the wall street journal rubio argued that high drug prices are the result of government regulations and the companies attempt to offset declining consumer demand as their products lose market share to newer rival treatments rubio said you ask yourself how is this possible there are less prescriptions being written for that drug and yet you re making more money on it than you ever have the answer is they re raising the prices dramatically and the reason they re raising the price dramatically is because they can the market will bear it it s just pure profiteering rubio wrote an op ed in politico on august 17 2015 detailing how to improve healthcare in the united states after repealing the rubio s plan would create an advanceable refundable tax credit that all americans can use to purchase health insurance reform insurance regulations and transition medicare to a premium support system rick santorum see also on october 13 2015 released his economic freedom agenda the centerpiece of the agenda was his 20 20 flat tax plan which proposed a 20 percent flat tax on individual income and a 20 percent flat tax on business income the plan also proposed repealing obamacare in order to pay for the flat tax proposal increasing the minimum wage approving the keystone xl pipeline creating work requirements for means tested entitlement programs and reducing legal and illegal immigration in november 2013 criticized the he said now it s the law the democrats knew it was a mess now nobody even knows how bad it is yet in an april 2012 op ed santorum wrote as the supreme court considers the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the
