              Republican Governor Mike Pence said Ted Cruz was a "principled conservative" AP            
                    
      

  
    
      
        Indiana Governor Mike Pence has given a somewhat lukewarm endorsement to Ted Cruz ahead of his state’s crucial presidential primary. The Hoosier State vote on 3 May could be Mr Cruz’s last chance to stop Donald Trump clinching the GOP nomination, after the Texas Senator picked up just one delegate from the five eastern states that voted earlier this week.

But while Mr Pence said he was backing Mr Cruz, he also heaped praise on the front-runner. “I particularly want to commend Donald Trump, who I think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with a lack of progress in Washington, DC,” the Republican governor said, in an interview with conservative Indianapolis radio host Greg Garrison.

“I’m also particularly grateful that Donald Trump has taken a strong stand for Hoosier jobs,” Mr Pence went on, referring to Mr Trump’s criticism of the Carrier air conditioner company’s imminent manufacturing move from Indiana to Mexico. “I’m not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary.”



The Indiana primary is a must-win for Mr Cruz, who is running out of opportunities to lure delegates away from The Donald, prevent him securing the necessary 1,237 majority and thus force a nomination fight at the part’s convention in July. Earlier this week he announced former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate, in a bid to reclaim the momentum.

Mr Trump nonetheless remains some five points ahead in Indiana polls. Mr Pence described Mr Cruz as a “principled conservative”, who had opposed “runaway spending”, Obamacare and abortion, saying he was “very impressed with Ted Cruz’s devotion [to] and knowledge of the Constitution of the United States.”

Speaking in Indianapolis ahead of the Governor’s endorsement, Mr Cruz said he had “tremendous respect” for Mr Pence, adding: “He has been an incredible leader for the state of Indiana. He has really demonstrated that when you cut taxes, when you reduce regulations, that jobs follow.”

Mr Pence’s conservative tenure has been controversial, even in a state long considered a Republican stronghold. He recently faced protests after signing a restrictive abortion bill, and last year suffered a backlash for approving Indiana’s so-called “religious freedom” law, which was seen by its opponents as anti-gay.

This weekend the remaining GOP candidates – Mr Trump, Mr Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich – will all descend on San Francisco for the California’s state Republican convention. When Donald Trump arrived in Orange County on Thursday for his first campaign appearance in California, he was met with protests that verged on violence.

In a taste of what could be to come as the Trump campaign turns its attention to the Golden State, around 20 people were arrested outside the rally at the Orange County Fairgrounds, after which hundreds of young anti-Trump protesters spilled into the streets, vandalising police cruisers and tossing rocks at passing traffic.
